I did my best to give these a chance, attending the first three, but they seemed to get progressively less relevant to a faith based on critical thinking. They are definitely not for me, but I worry that they aren’t real popular with others either. Counting teachers and students, the intergenerational Sundays clearly have less than half the number of participants in the education program as the other Sundays. For the most part, the kids don’t participate and those adults who do are often doing so just to be supportive. There isn’t any significant group who attend but don’t attend the regular education, so it doesn’t appear to be appealing to a different group. If this offering is going to be continued, I would strongly recommend doing it at a time other than during the regular Sunday education time rather than take the risk of putting more people in the mode of not attending Christian education. ¶ As to something “crucial,” I would argue that the whole program is crucial. It is interesting that the description of Worship at the beginning of this form says, “Worship is at the heart of ‘being church’... [i]t is through worship that we define who we are.” That is probably true if you see the salvific power of the Christ event in the pre-existence (John 1), incarnation, or bodily resurrection. But, if you see that power in the teaching of Jesus, not so much. Learning, then, is just as crucial and just as defining. ¶ If you want specifics, then foremost would be the Sunday school time. That needs to be for all ages and directed to those ages. That’s hard with a small group of kids, but even if we have only one kid in the 4th-5th grade age range, there needs to be some provision that doesn’t educate that kid at a 3rd grade level or a 6th-7th grade level. There also needs to be a vibrant, intellectually-oriented, adult program. We currently have that in the adult forum. Programs such as book club and film buffs seem to have a smaller appeal, but if they are of value to those who attend, then I see no reason not to continue them. ¶ One other point I had hoped would change this year: It often seems to me that our youth program has way too much of the YOU MUST DO... to it. For example, you MUST attend six retreats in order to be confirmed. Or, in the June Footnotes: “Those going to the Gathering are expected at ALL [ten] monthly meetings.” (emphasis in the original). Education needs to be fun, not a requirement. Our kids should want to participate, not be told they must participate. I know this had an effect on Ben and his pretty much dropping out of church post-confirmation. Also, I wonder how much impact this has had on the number of members we have in our congregation who have gone through our youth program in the past 35 years. By my count there are only four, and none under thirty – two fully active (Sarah and Erin) and two more in the official membership who are somewhat active (Jay and Florence).'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,0,174,'Christ the Servant has always been known for its emphasis on hunger-related service programs. This is particularly true with Gaithersburg HELP, but also Bread for the World, our support of the homeless shelter, McKenna’s Wagon (Martha’s Table), the city of Gaithersburg Thanksgiving baskets, and other short-term projects. Over the years, our pastor has served as president of HELP and at least four of our members have served as executive director. We are a Bread for the World covenant church. We have supported the homeless shelter, initially by housing residents in our basement, for probably the past 25 years. We have supported Martha’s Table by making lunches and by driving McKenna’s Wagon on the fifth Saturday of the month for probably 15 years. We’ve been doing Thanksgiving baskets since before I joined 35 years ago. All these projects are core to our identity and should be retained. ¶ Two other projects, less core to who we are but which I still think should be retained, are the school supplies drive and the Secret Santa program. These both seem to be well received and supported by our membership – e.g., we have a fund for purchasing Secret Santa gifts that aren’t picked up by members of the congregation; we haven’t used it in over ten years because everything is always accounted for my members. I think sometimes the biggest problem with these programs is a lack of support by the particular council member who happens to be responsible for them. ¶ I think we need to spend less time looking for new service opportunities and more time focusing on those we already do. For example, just looking at ourselves as a council, what have we done this past year to encourage members to be more actively involved with Gaithersburg HELP? Or, how supportive were we of the school supplies drive or Secret Santa program?'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,0,179,'We are called by Jesus’ teaching to reach out to and support those in need. We can’t very well do this if they don’t know we’re here. Just from that, it is critical that we make our presence known. I’m not so sure that that means that we need to somehow advertise our programs across all ministry areas. ¶ We should be using the Montgomery Village News, at a minimum, to get information about ourselves out to the wider community. It was interesting to see that the most recent Montgomery Village News had two references to CTS – one for hosting the farmers’ market and another in an article on the Alzheimer’s group that we host. Those are the kind of mentions of our congregation that we should be working to get out on a regular basis. Since the demise of the Gazette, I’m not sure what online sources of Gaithersburg news there are. To the extent that there are such sites, we should be trying to get mentions there as well. These don’t have to be articles about our congregational offerings. Just having mentions of the congregation hosting various activities gets our name in front of people. ¶ We also need to be seeking to be known for something. For example, as the church that works to fight hunger or that stands up for the oppressed. We talked at one point of signage indicating that we stand with the undocumented, but nothing came of that. Gaithersburg HELP serves those in need regardless of immigration status. That’s pretty much all HELP can do for the undocumented, but in the front window of the pantry we have two large signs (one in English, one in Spanish) listing county contact numbers and resources for the undocumented. We could easily do that much to serve those in need in our community.'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,0,186,'Years ago the congregation saw itself very much as a family. This was a recognition of the fact that most of us are transplants from elsewhere and so don’t have actual family in the area. That sense of family no longer exists to the same extent. Still, I think events such as congregational dinners are important because they do foster the feeling of family. It is unfortunate that we hold the dinners in the classrooms because it creates an environment where conversation is impossible due to the noise level, which leads to people not attending, which leads to less of a sense of family. ¶ I wouldn’t call them “important,” but I like the Advent and Lent soup suppers. The nice thing about them is their relatively small size and the fact they often lead to a single conversation around the table, thus avoiding the multiple conversations in one room and overwhelming noise that you get with the congregational dinners. ¶ As to what kind of activities I would want, I’m pretty open – tradition, not tradition, meh. Traditions are nice if they are meaningful, but it’s like with worship, there is no point in doing something merely because “we’ve always done it that way.” I personally prefer smaller to larger just because of hearing issues, but I much prefer scheduled to impromptu. I don’t tend to like over-planned, “you will do it this way,” events. ¶ As to how often we have congregational fellowship activities, we already do it weekly. It is called hospitality. (Now, if we could get more people to contribute to that...)'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,0,192,'The property, both inside and outside, needs to look as if we care about it. Right now, it doesn’t. Does that mean that we need to have manicured landscaping or keep everything immaculately clean? No. There is a basic level of care that needs to be present so potential visitors see that things are taken care of. Grass needs to be mown, large branches and trash picked up, gardens weeded, floors vacuumed, hymnals arranged neatly on chairs, etc. Much of that work can be done by volunteers (or just by basic education – who gets up and leaves after a worship service with his/her hymnal tossed on the floor?), but, if volunteers won’t do it, then we probably need to spend the money. ¶ The same logic applies to major cosmetic repairs. Other repairs (non-cosmetic) should be left to professionals and done properly the first time. ¶ As to whether I’m more likely to participate on scheduled work days or on an individual timeline, I can’t say one is more likely than the other. Over the years I’ve always participated in the workdays, but I also do things around the building on my own schedule apart from workdays.'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,0,194,'You don’t mention worship – here goes. ¶ As you say under property, apart from our web presence, the appearance of our property is the first impression we have on a potential visitor. Generally, the next impression we make on an actual visitor is our worship service. I think we have made progress from the point when the Synod’s Secret Visitor Program gave us a report that our worship gave the appearance that we were more concerned with “doing it right” then with any actual sense of worship. Much thanks are owed to Pastor Kari and Sarah for tamping down that obsession with “doing it right,” (as if there were one true and right way) while still largely maintaining a sense of reverence about the worship process. ¶ However, there remain behind-the-scenes problems that put a real strain on the time, talent, and energy of our members. In many cases these problems originate with a worship committee that is often largely dysfunctional. Sarah has, with much personal stress, navigated these problems admirably, but I worry about who has to deal with this next year. ¶ The worship committee was established some years ago at the recommendation of the MPAC committee (there’s a redundancy there because the C stands for committee; the MPA is Master Plan Advisory). I was the second chair of that committee. According to notes I have from committee discussions, the idea behind forming a worship committee was to have a group who would 1) have experience with our existing worship procedures and 2) support the council worship coordinator in implementing the pastor’s worship plans. It was never the intent to have the worship committee replace the pastor as the entity responsible for the formulation of our worship practices and services. The intent was that the committee would support the council worship coordinator by assisting with the implementation of the pastor’s vision. ¶ The discussions that MPAC had, envisioned the worship committee consisting of the pastor, the president, the council worship coordinator, the immediate past council worship coordinator (for continuity), the organist and/or music director(s), the bulletin prep person, and any of the individual servant area coordinators who were interested. Somehow, over the years this has been expanded to include anyone who is interested. The result is a committee that consists in part of a core group tasked with implementing worship and in part of individuals with no particular responsibility who often have their own concerns that interfere with and frustrate those we task with implementing our worship services. ¶ I would suggest that council consider returning to the original understanding of the worship committee as the core group in order to reduce the frustration and stress felt both by Pastor Kari and those working on a weekly basis to put together our worship services. ¶ One other general comment – I appreciate this chance to reflect on these various questions. These comments should be real helpful to council when we discuss the various positions at our June 12 meeting.

For example, just looking at ourselves as a council, what have we done this past year to encourage members to be more actively involved with Gaithersburg HELP? Or, how supportive were we of the school supplies drive or Secret Santa program?'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,1,179,'We are called by Jesus’ teaching to reach out to and support those in need. We can’t very well do this if they don’t know we’re here. Just from that, it is critical that we make our presence known. I’m not so sure that that means that we need to somehow advertise our programs across all ministry areas. ¶ We should be using the Montgomery Village News, at a minimum, to get information about ourselves out to the wider community. It was interesting to see that the most recent Montgomery Village News had two references to CTS – one for hosting the farmers’ market and another in an article on the Alzheimer’s group that we host. Those are the kind of mentions of our congregation that we should be working to get out on a regular basis. Since the demise of the Gazette, I’m not sure what online sources of Gaithersburg news there are. To the extent that there are such sites, we should be trying to get mentions there as well. These don’t have to be articles about our congregational offerings. Just having mentions of the congregation hosting various activities gets our name in front of people. ¶ We also need to be seeking to be known for something. For example, as the church that works to fight hunger or that stands up for the oppressed. We talked at one point of signage indicating that we stand with the undocumented, but nothing came of that. Gaithersburg HELP serves those in need regardless of immigration status. That’s pretty much all HELP can do for the undocumented, but in the front window of the pantry we have two large signs (one in English, one in Spanish) listing county contact numbers and resources for the undocumented. We could easily do that much to serve those in need in our community.'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,1,186,'Years ago the congregation saw itself very much as a family. This was a recognition of the fact that most of us are transplants from elsewhere and so don’t have actual family in the area. That sense of family no longer exists to the same extent. Still, I think events such as congregational dinners are important because they do foster the feeling of family. It is unfortunate that we hold the dinners in the classrooms because it creates an environment where conversation is impossible due to the noise level, which leads to people not attending, which leads to less of a sense of family. ¶ I wouldn’t call them “important,” but I like the Advent and Lent soup suppers. The nice thing about them is their relatively small size and the fact they often lead to a single conversation around the table, thus avoiding the multiple conversations in one room and overwhelming noise that you get with the congregational dinners. ¶ As to what kind of activities I would want, I’m pretty open – tradition, not tradition, meh. Traditions are nice if they are meaningful, but it’s like with worship, there is no point in doing something merely because “we’ve always done it that way.” I personally prefer smaller to larger just because of hearing issues, but I much prefer scheduled to impromptu. I don’t tend to like over-planned, “you will do it this way,” events. ¶ As to how often we have congregational fellowship activities, we already do it weekly. It is called hospitality. (Now, if we could get more people to contribute to that...)'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,1,192,'The property, both inside and outside, needs to look as if we care about it. Right now, it doesn’t. Does that mean that we need to have manicured landscaping or keep everything immaculately clean? No. There is a basic level of care that needs to be present so potential visitors see that things are taken care of. Grass needs to be mown, large branches and trash picked up, gardens weeded, floors vacuumed, hymnals arranged neatly on chairs, etc. Much of that work can be done by volunteers (or just by basic education – who gets up and leaves after a worship service with his/her hymnal tossed on the floor?), but, if volunteers won’t do it, then we probably need to spend the money. ¶ The same logic applies to major cosmetic repairs. Other repairs (non-cosmetic) should be left to professionals and done properly the first time. ¶ As to whether I’m more likely to participate on scheduled work days or on an individual timeline, I can’t say one is more likely than the other. Over the years I’ve always participated in the workdays, but I also do things around the building on my own schedule apart from workdays.'),('BRK-3LS-8QX-6N7',2017,1,194,'You don’t mention worship – here goes. ¶ As you say under property, apart from our web presence, the appearance of our property is the first impression we have on a potential visitor. Generally, the next impression we make on an actual visitor is our worship service. I think we have made progress from the point when the Synod’s Secret Visitor Program gave us a report that our worship gave the appearance that we were more concerned with “doing it right” then with any actual sense of worship. Much thanks are owed to Pastor Kari and Sarah for tamping down that obsession with “doing it right,” (as if there were one true and right way) while still largely maintaining a sense of reverence about the worship process. ¶ However, there remain behind-the-scenes problems that put a real strain on the time, talent, and energy of our members. In many cases these problems originate with a worship committee that is often largely dysfunctional. Sarah has, with much personal stress, navigated these problems admirably, but I worry about who has to deal with this next year. ¶ The worship committee was established some years ago at the recommendation of the MPAC committee (there’s a redundancy there because the C stands for committee; the MPA is Master Plan Advisory). I was the second chair of that committee. According to notes I have from committee discussions, the idea behind forming a worship committee was to have a group who would 1) have experience with our existing worship procedures and 2) support the council worship coordinator in implementing the pastor’s worship plans. It was never the intent to have the worship committee replace the pastor as the entity responsible for the formulation of our worship practices and services. The intent was that the committee would support the council worship coordinator by assisting with the implementation of the pastor’s vision. ¶ The discussions that MPAC had, envisioned the worship committee consisting of the pastor, the president, the council worship coordinator, the immediate past council worship coordinator (for continuity), the organist and/or music director(s), the bulletin prep person, and any of the individual servant area coordinators who were interested. Somehow, over the years this has been expanded to include anyone who is interested. The result is a committee that consists in part of a core group tasked with implementing worship and in part of individuals with no particular responsibility who often have their own concerns that interfere with and frustrate those we task with implementing our worship services. ¶ I would suggest that council consider returning to the original understanding of the worship committee as the core group in order to reduce the frustration and stress felt both by Pastor Kari and those working on a weekly basis to put together our worship services. ¶ One other general comment – I appreciate this chance to reflect on these various questions. These comments should be real helpful to council when we discuss the various positions at our June 12 meeting.

Ideally, specific service projects should arise out of each person\'s unique calling, but recognizing that may not be practical, it does become the responsibility of leadership to identify and support priority service areas. It strikes me that these priority areas of service are those in which members are inspired, invested and already offer leadership (examples: Gaithersburg HELP, Polly Brody\'s energy and efforts towards disaster relief, Rob\'s willingness to keep us connected to Martha\'s Table and McKenna\'s Wagon). How do we as leaders encourage more of this since for these individuals, such efforts clearly are part of their calling and not just another task or commitment that they\'ve agreed to do? Leadership can dream up all kinds of wonderful projects, but if no one comes forward to help implement them, then it\'s a scramble to find a coordinator, and the task frequently falls to those who already contribute so much time and energy to CTS.
